0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

You can find the source code here
The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
You don’t have to understand what import, random. randint do. Please do not touch this code
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line
